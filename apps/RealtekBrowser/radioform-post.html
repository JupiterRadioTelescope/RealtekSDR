<h3>About HTMLgen</h3>

 
 <P>The form is generated with Python module HTMLgen, which provides full form
 support using the POST method. It provides an Input class supporting all input
 types including script callbacks. The Input class also has two convenience
 attributes, <code>llabel</code> and <code>rlabel</code>, which place plain
 text to the left and right of the widget respectively. For persistant data
 between form invocations, the StickyForm class is used.
